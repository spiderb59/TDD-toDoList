# Todo List App

This Todo List App allows users to manage their tasks effectively without the need for a database. Users can add, edit, and delete todo items directly within the browser.

## Features

- **Add Todo:** Users can add new todo items by filling out a form with the title, description, due date, and priority of the task.
- **Edit Todo:** Users can edit existing todo items to update their details such as title, description, due date, and priority.
- **Delete Todo:** Users can delete todo items they no longer need, removing them from the list.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Fill out the form to add a new todo item.
3. Click on the "Edit" button next to a todo item to edit its details.
4. Click on the "Delete" button next to a todo item to remove it from the list.

## No Database Usage

This app does not require a database for storage. Todo items are managed directly within the browser's memory using JavaScript arrays. Therefore, all data is temporary and will be lost upon page refresh.

## Teaching Tutorial

This project serves as a teaching tutorial for learning how to create a simple todo list application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates the basics of handling form submissions, manipulating the DOM, and managing data without the need for a backend database.
